# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the implementation of the Google Maps JavaScript API for the Bay Wheels Planner and the Introduction chapter of Nature of Code

**Thoughts:**
Getting the directions from the Google Maps JavaScript API was easy but the elevations part was difficult because it required implementing the Steepless code. All of the different routes elevations must be fetched before I can implement any of the analysis from Steepless. I am in the middle of retaking the Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript from Treehouse because of my rusty familiarity of the different methods.

I completed reading through the Introduction of Daniel Shiffman's, The Nature of Code, and I learned about the different ways to implement randomness. I do not feel I thoroughly understand the material because I was not able to complete the exercises in the Introduction chapter. I made goals today for the different things I want to accomplish during this challenge. Even if I only complete some I will be happy since many of these things have been on my To-Do list for two or more years.

### Day 2: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying the code of Steepless and also started reading the Nature of Code

**Thoughts:**
Today I deleted the code from my Bay Wheels Planner application just thrown in from the Steepless project without any understanding to what it did. Let's be real, the Steepless application is already better in a lot of ways (timing of release, the larger scope of audience, etc.), but my purpose for making Bay Wheels Planner is to use it as a project to learn from and honestly enjoy. The official Bay Wheels app does not have such a feature yet, or really any planning feature, so I am happy to learn and make something useful (even if only for myself).

Reading Daniel Shiffman's 'The Nature of Code' is always something I have wanted to do and it will be done by the end of this challenge. Sure the technology is nothing that will get me a job (p5 is not a very desired technology skill), but as my Tweet said for today, 'Nice thing bout havin a cool job (and not job searchin) is that I can work on the stuff I love ❤️ without worry if I'm 'doing the right thing.'

### Day 1: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying the code of Steepless

**Thoughts:**
When I have a very a little amount of lines of code to commit to Github, I feel that I am unproductive. However, contrary to my belief, a deeper understanding of the code I am trying to implement is what will make me application great. In the past, a lot of times I start drawings with no plan and that is often how my coding has been in the past. They turn out fine. However, with code, I know it will help me to understand each part of the code and how each part integrates with another. Otherwise, it will get messy. Also, I won't be able to talk to anyone about it.

### Day 0: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Life project, studied the code of Steepless

**Thoughts:**
Today I restart this challenge. I do not want to count how many times I have restarted. I looked up Lim Chee Aun, the creator of Steepless, the application that I am using parts of it's code for my Bay Wheels Planner application. Lim Chee Aun was featured on Hacker News for his Life application (https://github.com/cheeaun/life). Today I made a fork to help map out my own life.
