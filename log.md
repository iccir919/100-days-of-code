# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Working on blog, Ford GoBike Dashboard, and the App Script project for the University of Haifa

**Thoughts:** 
This past week has been one of the worst for me in terms of coding. Despite having time to code, for some reason I did not do it. I am committing today to coding for at least one hour a day on a project. It is not good for me to code a lot during one day of the week and then completely remove myself from code from all the others. 

For my Ford GoBike Dashboard project, I wanted to use one of the latest data visualiation libraries, [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis), but ultimately I decide to continue using Chartist and hopefully, in the future, I will switch over.

I restarted the Vis Academy today. I started it in January and never got around to finishing it. Actually, currently it is impossible to finish because part of the course is obsolete because of the newer version of the library.
