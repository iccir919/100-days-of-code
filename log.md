# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarting mapping tool to find flattest routes and avoid the hilliest routes.

**Thoughts:**
I am excited to restart this challenge. It has been 10 months since I last attempted it. **I will not fail this time.** This application will be made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a declarative and component-based JavaScript library. Since it has been a while (and the API has maybe changed since I last worked with React), I have completed the first half of one React tutorial, "A Step-by-step Guide to React" (see link below). I am taking notes from the tutorial (more like copy and pasting key parts of the tutorial) in a neat application called Notion, like an online journal
