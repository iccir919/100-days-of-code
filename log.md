### Day 50: May 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing the videos from the CSS Flexbox Layout Coure from Team Treehouse. Working through the exercises from Learn CSS Flexbox section from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I skipped another day. What was a once in a while thing has now become a weekly occurrence. How dedicated am I to this challenge? It is not like there is anything more important in my life. I just don't take my life serious. There is not enough dedication and passion from me. What was supposed to be completed during this work week, Responsive Web Design Certification, has been pushed off to this weekend. I know where I want to be but I don't think I have thought enough about the effort it will take to get there. For the past few days, the dates of this journal have been all mixed up, which I believe is a good indicator to my mental state. I did not complete my goal for having streaks (meaning continuous activity) on all of the websites I am using during this challenge: freeCodeCamp, Github, Code Signal, and Team Treehouse. Even just a little progress Neil is better than nothing. Do not let anymore days pass where I do nothing.

### Day 49: May 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Technical Documentation Page Project to the point where it pasts all the tests and looks okay. Also, worked through some challenges from Code Signal.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to get this project to a "Done" enough state that I can submit it to freeCodeCamp. However, my hope is that I do not completely leave it alone moving forward. I still want to apply the lessons I will learn in the upcoming sections from freeCodeCamp to these projects to make them the best as possible. It felt good to be able to look at the example project and know how to make my project look like it with CSS. Some extra features that might be interesting to consider for this project is adding "Night Mode," something a lot of the big and small websites are adding. There is this feeling in me that I am just repeating what I have already accomplished in the past and that I have not made any true progress. There are a lot of technologies that I have avoided, like SASS, that are industry standards but I have not pushed myself to learn. However, I will not get too discouraged. I am building a strong foundation, so that learning these new technologies hopefully will not be more like adding on to what I already know.

### Day 48: May 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Survey Form and the Tribute Page projects for Responsive Web Design Certification for freeCodeCamp and got through some of the questions from the Arcade section with JavaScript with Code Signal

**Thoughts:** Wahoo, today I actually completed some projects for freeCodeCamp. It is nice to finally have some of the checkmarks for the Responsive Web Design Certification Projects marked after such a long time of little progress. Now, I have to talk about the bad aspect. My projects very much look like the tutorials from Team Treehouse and examples from freeCodeCamp. It is just interesting to me that I would so blatantly copy the design of others projects. I used to tell people the reason I loved front end development was the creative expression it allowed. But to be honest, it is come up with beautiful designs. The disappoint of what I thought this would and what is my current reality is causing me to have not having as much fun as I thought I would when I told people about my ambitions for this profession. The reason I want to continue moving forward with these projects is to continue moving forward. I have said this before but my hope is that I will continue to come back to them to improve upon as I learn more and more.

### Day 47: May 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed reviewing the videos for the following courses: CSS Basics and Responsive Layouts for Team Treehouse and Completed a couple of SQL questions from Code Signal.

**Thoughts:** Today was a lot of reviewing Team Treehouse videos that I have already watched like a couple of months. The material is obviously nothing to me but it does refresh my memory of the topics about CSS layout properties (float, display, the box model, box sizing, etc.). The most important thing is that I keep myself immersed in CSS by continuing to practice this knowledge. My main problem is that these tutorials explain a concept and I think I understand after completing it but the truth is that when it comes down to the moment of making something on my own, I feel lost. These more I practice CSS, then the less impossible it will seem. The reason I have started to learn SQL is today at work I realized how helpful querying our databases can be for my technical investigations. So many times in my past I have just dabbled in these topics. Now I want to spark the flame but let it continue to burn.

### Day 46: May 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through the CSS Layout Project section. This is my favorite because it is not passive learning.

**Thoughts:** Goal for next week: break my current longest streak of five days for consistent Github commits and freeCodeCamp lessons progress. I'm disappointed with my progress this weekend, just like I have been for most of the past weekends. Despite my thought on Friday of how excited I am for the idea of what I can accomplish during the weekend, my actions show my true color. The urge for escape is strong with me and it seems by the way I behave, I don't want to work on any code during the weekend. However, this is far from the truth. Completing a project brings me more joy than any of the things that I do during the weekend: watch a lot of YouTube, television shows, movies, etc. It also didn't help that I drank with my brother. We definitely did too much this time; sleeping late and being lethargic all through the next day is a waste of the potential. Today I completed a project course from Treehouse and the interactivity with having to complete tasks based off the material covered in previous videos has made this one of my favorites.

### Day 45: April 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed videos from sections: The Box Model, Basic Layout, Getting Started with CSS Layout, and Controlling Layout with CSS Display Modes

**Thoughts:** During my last round of this challenge, someone reminded me to build things during this challenge, not just get stuck in tutorial hell. While all I did for today was watch tutorial videos, I have the full intention of applying this knowledge to my freeCodeCamp projects this weekend. One goal fo mine is to use at least one one of these three layout tools: Floats, Flexbox, and CSS Grid. While watching all of these videos for CSS layout, I am thinking about which tool will serve what project best. It's funny how I thought that I would be so far along with these freeCodeCamp projects last weekend but I don't think I had considered how much there is to learn. I will be if I complete all of the freeCodeCamp projects by the end of the next week, so long as they look good and I really feel like I understand each of their CSS and HTML code. Here are some more goals I have for these freeCodeCamp projects. One goal is that each project should have a mobile first approach, meaning that I will start each design with the smallest screen in mind and grow bigger. Another goal of mine for these projects is to apply every topic from the freeCodeCamp lessons for Responsive Web Design into these four projects.

### Day 44: April 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed all of the videos from Understanding Values and Units from Team Treehouse and worked on the CSS for my Survey From project for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Another day where I do not get done as much as I had planned. Nevertheless, I am happy that I continued to make progress. While I thought I knew everything about Understanding Values and Units, the subject of relative lengths units was something I have never incorporated into many of my previous projects. Here is how font-relative units are helpful: let's say I am going to need to change the size of a whole bunch of font sizes at once, for instance when I am adjusting for a large to mobile screen, then I want to base all of those text sizes off of one root size. This example shows the brilliance of using using rem for selecting the font size for all of the fonts. Wait, am I actually talking about code for once in this log? Well, let me set things back on track that by writing in this entry something personal. For the longest time, I have lived in a fantasy that I am a web developer but my track record would show quite the opposite truth. I attended a bootcamp thinking I could pay my way into this opportunity. Then after the bootcamp, I never got the web developer job and I have been paying for that bootcamp with customer support positions. There is nothing wrong with this type of work; in fact, I love my current position that combines techincal problem solving with support. What was wrong is that before this position is that I kept telling people that I am a web developer but I never worked on any code like I am now. I was living in a fantasy, a farse, and a lie.

### Day 43: April 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the videos about Getting Started with CSS and Basic Selectors for Team Treehouse and completed building out the HTML structure for my Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Sigh, I completed today what I wanted to this past weekend. When I log on to Twitter, I get depressed because other people have been able to continue the challenge everyday and now I am behind them. I had envisioned us completing the challenge on the same day and celebrating together; another example of how much I am looking into what lies ahead rather than being in the present. Now that I have completed the HTML part of my Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects, I move into the CSS part. I consider myself such a visually oriented person, telling myself and others that I love the presentation aspect of coding, and yet, I really am dragging my feet to work through this material about CSS. What keeps me motivated is that by continuing to move forward, I will soon complete four of my goals for this challenge.

### Day 42: April 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewing videos about HTML Forms from Team Treehouse and continuing to build out the HTML skeleton structure for my Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects

**Thoughts:** I really messed up this weekend, and if anyone took a look at the previous logs in this journal (paying close to attention to the weekends), then they would have been easily able to predict such a disaster. I spent the weekend messing around, doing anything but being productive. Like a mini vacation, except it was actually pretty toxic and made me feel worse about myself rather than rejuvenating. Yesterday, I got myself so hyped that I am doing so well and that I am *going* to be so productive in the next upcoming days. I start losing myself in the future rather than living in the **now**. It would be easy to blame my brother for asking me to drink with him but that was only during the nighttime. I had all of the daytime available to me but I chose to not code. Despite taking more than a day off from this challenge, I am not restarting it. My mental goal for the second half will to not let myself get carried away in the future or past because both are so detremintal to my progress. I want to make realistic goals for each day and try my best to complete them.

### Day 41: April 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed all videos from HTML Basics from Team Treehouse, working on building out the HTML skeleton structure for my Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects for freeCodeCamp, and completed exercises from Chapter 14 - The Document Object Model from Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Today was a productive day for me. I really feel like I am using all of the resources that I have available to me right now. However, in reviewing the Team Treehouse videos, I do get that feeling again that I keep going backwards because this is something that I did like three months ago. The only way to get rid of this feeling is to keep moving forward, Neil; do not stop. I am thrilled to complete another chapter of Eloquent JavaScript, especially this chapter since it marks being two thirds done with this book. The freeCodeCamp projects offer a great opportunity to practice my web development skills. I hope to be done with my Responsive Web Design Projects soon!

### Day 40: April 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through the Basic CSS version of the Responsive Web Design Certification for freeCodeCamp and through the exercises of Chapter 14 - The Document Object Model of Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Today is another day of synchronicity, though it was planned by me. I just love when the material of two resources that I am using come together. Today was about learning HTML and CSS. No matter how many times I go over these two topics, I always feel like I am learning something new. I am happy that I am working on freeCodeCamp projects and through the chapter exercises of Eloquent JavaScript because it adds some green boxes to my Github commit history timeline. It is crazy that in all the weeks from the start of this challenge to now that I have not had one week that I committed to Github everyday.

### Day 39: April 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Basic HTML and HTML5 section for the Responsive Web Design Certification for freeCodeCamp. Reading through Chapter 14 - The Document Object Model of Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** My personal life issues are getting in the way of completing my goals for this challenge. I have been dealing with the same issues for a long time now. Recently, I have tried again to fix them but it seems futile and like a waste of energy. I started my hour of code very late late into the night since I spent a lot of time talking about resolutions to my life issues with others but I am now tired. Nonetheless, I was able to complete Basic HTML and HTML5, the first section of the Responsive Web Design Certification. This will be like the third time that I will have completed this certification. Nonetheless, I will make it the best by combining all of the material from freeCodeCamp with Team Treehouse to create my best looking projects yet.

### Day 38: April 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification for freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Today I did something that I have never done before in all my years of coding, actually completed the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification from freeCodeCamp. I spent so much time on the last lesson, Positive and Negative Lookahead, which is of course from the Regular Expressions section. I want to talk about this lesson, extract a teaching from my pains, and make the time I wasted on it worth it. I kept typing in the same answer expecting something different. I wish I would have asked, "What is wrong?" and took a look at what was in front of me with an objective eye. What was I basing my fact(s) off from that makes me believe my answer to be correct? I often do the same thing at work. A personal and subjective goal for this challenge is to become a better problem solver by learning to change the way I approach something complicated or difficult. Rather than just be insane and do the same thing, become conscious, pausing and reflecting on the matter, and trying to not let my own emotion take over my thought process. It's funny to me how I was telling myself that I just wouldn't get this lesson because I am not good with regular expressions. In the end, I cheated and looked at this solution, but I hope this entry and whatever my future self takes from it makes the guilt worth it.

### Day 37: April 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification 

**Thoughts:** Progress towards completing this certificiation is steady but not as fast as I imagine. However, has any goal of mine  really been completed on time? I remember when my mom would tell me four years ago after college that I am almost thirty years old and should try to move out immediately. I told her that she was crazy then, however here we are now, and there are only months until my thirtieth birthday. I wish I had more to say about coding today but I feel like much with anything, your personal life can affect your progress with that thing. I hate to be on a sob train but I have not ever been really good at something before, just always mediocre. Today I had another book club session for the book The Power of Now. By reading it, I am reminded to let go of these pains from the past or anxieties about the future.

### Day 36: April 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification 

**Thoughts:** Today I worked on challenges from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification by freeCodeCamp. Though it has been a real struggle today to get much done because of staying up too late last night with my brother, drinking alcohol and talking about whatever. We talk so much about ourselves and other people, but how little action we really do. This reminds me of myself before I started this challenge. I would tell people my 'story,' but it became clear none of it mattered. Only my actual work did; my projects, my never contributing to open source projects, etc. My goal was to finish a this certification by this weekend but due to drinking too much, I do not have the energy to make it happen.

### Day 35: April 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Functional Programming of freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Today was a tough day. I felt like I hardly had time or enevery to code after putting out the fires both at work and within my family. I feel this whole certification  sould be simple since I claim to have surrounded myself with JavaScript for the past three or more years. The further I get into this challenge, the more I love it. I am starting to think to myself on a daily basis, "When will I have time to make coding progress toady?" As a single man who lives with his parents, I do not believe there is any reason to believe why I cannot accomplish what I set my mind to.

### Day 34: April 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working through Functional Programming and Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

**Thoughts:** Today was my Mom's birthday. I say this as an excuse to explain my lack of progress today. Strangely, yesterday's announcemnt of my completion of those two sections in this JavaScript certification was my most liked tweet on Twitter. It makes me wonder where I will be in another thirty days? There is this cazy vision in my head of actually completing this JavaScipt certification from freeCodeCamp and posting it on my Twitter by the end of this weekend. To me it is funny that I am excited for the responses of strangers on the Internet but know that I will get very little reaction from my immediate family. Despite my lack of noteable progress today, I have been reminding myself during this whole challenge, I belive that some days it is okay to not have progress like everyone else.

### Day 33: April 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: For freeCodeCamp: Completed Basic Data Structures and Completed Object Oriented Programming

**Thoughts:** Today was a tough day at work because of the stimulus checks being sent to tons of American's bank accounts. I barely made it through the tickets I was assigned today at work. Interestingly, in terms of work and this challenge, I never feel like I am accomplishing enough each day. Compared to my co-workers, I feel like I should be doing more than I am. Compared to everyone in this challenge, I hope that I will be able to at least finish at least the majority of the tasks on my goal list by the end of this challenge. Today in my freeCodeCamp sectionst that I covered, I was reintroduced to the exciting world of prototypes and constructors in JavaScript. While these concepts are a major component of the language, I feel that with all of the new frameworks and syntax with JavaScript, that they can get easily lost. I guess if I ever missed seeing such vanilla JavaScript in the future that I can always convert my new JavaScript code with a compiler like Babel.

**Links to work:**

### Day 32: April 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: For freeCodeCamp: Completed the ES6 section. Also completed the Basic Algorithm Scripting section 

**Thoughts:** There is a lot of new ES6 syntax to try out in future projects. My hope was that by reading through latest version of Eloquent JavaScript that I would have learned about most of it but I feel like there was a lot that as left out in the book. Luckily, I have all this material from freeCodeCamp and I will try to implement the new syntax into my future projects.

> “For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.” -Aristotle

I am also happy to have completed the Basic Algorithm Scripting section. While this is a smaller victory, it brings me one step closer to obtaining the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. In all my years of coding, I don't think I have yet obtained this certification. Like the book Eloquent JavaScript, I know that I will have to go over the material in the future to make sure that I fully understand the content, especially in regards to ES6. I must keep to up to date on JavaScript's latest syntax to be able to stay relevant in the community.

### Day 31: April 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Missed a day but it's okay. Today I worked through the random parts of the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

**Thoughts:** I missed a day because I took a break and got a little crazy with my family for Easter. We all watched the the movie "Cats" together. While I would love to say everyone had fun, in some ways, I feel it was mostly me and my brother. I _hate_ when my fun takes over the fun of others around me. In terms of coding, today I was unfocused. Rather than focus on certain sections from the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification, I just picked random easy topics. I just wanted to feel a sense of progress after feeling like I took so many steps back last night. I hate missing a day from being totally consistent during this challenge. However, I am happy to have got right back into it. 

**Links to work:**
- [My freeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/iccir919)

### Day 30: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  For Eloquent JavaScript: Completed the exercises from Chapter 12: Project: A Programming Language and Read through all of Chapter 13: JavaScript and the Browser. For freeCodeCamp: Completed all 110 exercises of the Basic JavaScript section

**Thoughts:** Today I reflected on my previous entried in this log. Anxiety about my lack of substantial progress, excitement for contributing to The Nature of Code, drinking alcohol holding me back, the annoyance of repeating the same material, and learning of new concepts were some of the common themes. I wanted to post some of these to Twitter but I realized that threads, a feature of Twitter, are absolutely horrible. In a strange twist of my ambitions during this challenge, I have decided to put a pause on Eloquent JavaScript. My new focus is reviewing and applying the knowledge I gained from Eloquent JavaScript to obtaining the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

### Day 29: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Chapter 12 - Project: A Programming Language from the book Eloquent JavaScript, which describes building a language, Egg, on top of JavaScript. Read through it and currently working through its exercises. 

**Thoughts:** The title of this chapter is very intimidating; Really, we are going to build a programming language!? Fortunately, the material was not as challenging as the previous chapter Asynchronous Programming. In fact, it was pretty insightful to how the JavaScript language works. I had not really thought about operators as being like functions until this chapter went over creating them for our own programming language. Additionally, I enjoyed taking a closer look into how scope operates, especially in the context of the creation of a new functions. My dad wanted to watch a movie tonight (after we had already watched an hour long television show) and I turned down the offer in favor of working through this chapter. Overall, I am happy with this decision because I really wanted to get over this "Language" section (Chapter 1 - Chapter 12) of Eloquent JavaScript and into the "Browser" section.

### Day 28: April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 🙌Completed🙌 the exercises of Chapter 11: Asynchronous Programming from the book Eloquent JavaScript. I took the hints but I didn't give up and look at the solutions

**Thoughts:** Guess what? After all my struggle with completing just the first exercise challenge, do you know what my problem was with not making any progress? I did not understand the exercise and its directions. There was clear instruction to use one function from the chapter but I used another because I thought it was the correct function. I was wrong. Once I realized this fact, the answers started to come to my mind. Sure, I used the hints, but I think after spending four days on the same chapter that I earned the right to use them. For my tweet out today, I gave a shout out to my follower Masa from Japan who gave me a shout out a couple of days earlier. This type of motivation is what makes this whole challenge successful, the support of others, even if they are strangers.

### Day 27: April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Still working through the exercises of Chapter 11 from the book Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I am not going to lie, I did not spend a lot of time on learning programming today. I hit a low. My chess scores have been declining and that is an indicator of me giving up easily and not thinking any steps ahead. When I spend four days on the same chapter, there is something wrong with me. Fortunately, I attended my book club meeting for The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle. I was reminded me to take an honest look around at my current state. I realized it was not all bad as my mind can make it all seem, whether it is my past regrets or anxious thoughts about the future. Often my lack of progress in this challenge annoys me, but I shouldn't let such thoughts get me so down.

### Day 26: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: My progress through the exercises of Chapter 11: Asynchronous Programming from the book Eloquent JavaScript is slow. Reading through tweets by Syk Houdeib about how he found this book challenging has made me feel better bout my struggle. 

**Thoughts:** I am still going over Chapter 11: Asynchronous Programming from the book Eloquent JavaScript. I feel horrible about not making any progress with it. To better understand if I was the only having trouble with this book, I looked for any tweets from others have made their way through the book. I found a tweet from last year by Syk Houdeib about how challenging the book was for him to get through. I have read an article many times on Medium by Syk about how to land your first job as a web developer. To know that he had trouble with the material of the book comforted me because I knew that he maybe knows more than me (at least for now). I mentioned him in my tweet for today. Syk liked it, responded, and followed me.

### Day 25: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rereading Chapter 11 of Eloquent JavaScript. 

**Thoughts:** Here I am, reading a chapter that uses a metaphor about a computer network setup by crows to help me understand the Internet and how to use asynchronous functions. I hope I don't sound too salty but the way the author of this books is equating something complicated like the Internet to something simple makes me angry because I personally feel like an idiot for not understanding the material. Fortunately, I went back to the Introduction from this book and found a quote that has resonated with me during this difficult time: 

```
"When you're struggling to follow, don't jump to any conclusions about your own capabilities.

Learning is hard work, but everything you learn is yours and will make subsequent learning easier."
```

There is no doubt that asynchronous programming is challenging for me. I remember when at Hack Reactor that it was a topic I never understood but like most things during that experience, I faked knowing it. Fortunately, I now have the time to go back over the material. There is no social pressure to make me move on, despite not understanding the material.  I soon will have to stop paying back my loan for that damn bootcamp. Let all of the rage and regret for attending that bootcamp be the energy that pushes me to learn more about web development.

### Day 24: April 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Updated my my personal website with links to my 100DaysOfCode Log and my freeCodeCamp Profile. Also, continued to work through Chapter 11: Asynchronous Programming from the book Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** This chapter, Chapter 11: Asynchronous Programming, has been extremely tough for me. Asynchronous programming is confusing. I hate not moving on to the next chapter of this book today. I am a quarter through this challenge and only halfway through this book. How will I complete the six other tasks on my goal list when just one task has taken me this long? My hope is that by truly understanding the chapters of this book, I will be able to move through the other tasks on my goal with more confidence and agility. Breathing helps me realize with these anxious feelings. After I take a deep breathe, I realize that if I accomplish only three of tasks on my goal list during the #100DaysOfCode challenge, then that is further than I was before. There is always Round 2, Neil. Having to put some tasks off until a later time may be disappointing, but try to look at the next round of this challenge like the better sequel to the original.

### Day 23: April 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the exercises from Chapter 10: Modules from the book Eloquent JavaScript 

**Thoughts:** I had to use the hint for the last exercise from Chapter 10: Modules of the book Eloquent JavaScript. When I use the hints for an exercise question, I feel like I do not really understand the material of the chapter. The exercise I had trouble with was about circular dependencies, which is a situation where module A depends on B, and B also, directly or indirectly, depends on A. Unlike other programming languages, JavaScript does allow circular dependencies because the require function is able to accomodate circular dependencies without crashing; this is possible since require stores a dependency in its cache before it actually loads the code. Requie will not load a dependency again if it is already within the cache. This way, if a dependency is called for multiple times, then the require function will not be load the same dependency over and over again. I feel this exercise question would make a great blog post topic since the material I found online about this topic was not completely clear or helpful to me.

### Day 22: April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Reading through Chapter 10: Modules of Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Modules have always been this magical part of JavaScript for me. Like in one sense, they seem like a really simple thing since they are just snippets of code that can be exported from one file and then imported into another. The complicated part is understanding what is going on behind the scenes. I appreciated how this chapter went over (a maybe simplified version of) the require function. I would like to make a blog post in the future how the require function operates for others (and myself). On a seemingly unrelated note (but I promise it has a point), today at work I attended a workshop on growing my career. I realized something that I want to do is help improve our internal documentation. However, I do not have much exerperience with writing stuff like it, so I can start with making a blog.

### Day 21: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the exercises from Chapter 9: Regular Expressions from Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Another day with not a lot of progress. After work, I went on a run with my dog, which I have not done in a while. I have gained a lot of weight since last summer, like 40 pounds. I hope to lose at least 20 pounds by the end of this challenge. Oh wait, this journal is about my code progress! I have completed the exercises from the chapter about regular expressions in the book Eloquent JavaScript, but I used the hints for solving the exercises. I feel a little weak for having to use the hints but there was still a great sense of accomplishment when I completed the exercises. It is cool that these exercises have tests inlcuded with them, so I really knew when I had the correct answer. It took three days to complete this one chapter. The feeling that I have not accomplished enough crept back into my mind when I read through the tweets by others who are in the progress of completing this challenge. Try not to compare yourself to them, Neil; keep focused on your [goals](goals.md).

### Day 20: April 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continuing my progress on Chapter 9: Regular Expressions from Eloquent JavaScript. Also, I reset my freeCodeCamp and Code Signal accounts. New beginnings!

**Thoughts:** To be honest, I did not make much progress today. It is my parents anniversary, so the time that I usually work on coding stuff was taken by preparing them dinner. Then after dinner, we watched a movie. Throughout all of this, we were all drinking alcohol. Now, at the night, I feel pretty tired and not really able to code. I'm resetting my Code Signal and freeCodeCamp accounts so that I can relearn what I went over months and months ago. Hopefully, if I did actually absorb the material, then it should be quick to get back where I was before the reset. Completing some of the freeCodeCamp sections is one of the goals of this challenge.

### Day 19: March 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Working though Chapter 9: Regular Expressions from the book Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I kind of knew that the chapter of Eloquent JavaScript about regular expressions would take me longer than any of the previous chapters. In many ways, it feels like learning an entirely new language. I used to just ignore regular expressions because I never found myself needing to use them. However, they can be a key part of a parsing task, like data aggregation from other websites. JavaScript libraries like Puppeteer can help with navigating through websites that desired information, like [rcdb.com](https://rcdb.com/) for example, but regular expressions are needed to transform the information from HTML into useable JSON. Also, Daniel Shiffman has used regular expressions for text analysis projects. In fact, I started to work on one of these projects three years ago. It rearranged the lyrics of Radiohead songs.

### Day 18: March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed all of the exercises from Chapter 8 of Eloquent JavaScript. Topics like TypeScript and testing frameworks are briefly mentioned but understandably not covered. 

**Thoughts:** Chapter 8 of Eloquent JavaScript goes over handling bugs and errors. To be honest, none of the JavaScript code I have written handles errors. I always assume that everything will just work and this is wrong. TypeScript is a JavaScript dialect that I have been meaning to look into (as many job descriptions require knowledge of it) but I have not made the effort to learn it. My assumption for what it does is that it makes JavaScript more like Java by requiring the programmer to declare the type (number, string, object, etc.) of a variable or output of a function. TypeScript will probably throw an error if the type is different than what is expected. Testing is also something that I have not done before for any of my projects (but is also a common recurring job description requirement). I have read often on Twitter that one thing professional programmers wish they knew more about before starting their job is testing. I want to level up on these topics, but right now, the goal is just to finally finish this book.

### Day 17: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercises from Chapter 7 and in the midst of reading Chapter 8 of Eloquent JavaScript. Also watching the accompanying YouTube videos for Chapter 1 of The Nature of Code that Shiffman has recently uploaded. 

**Thoughts:** I spent three hours on the second exercise, Robot Efficiency, from Chapter 7 of Eloquent JavaScript. I started out with the right idea to find the shortest route but my execution was poor. There was an error within my code that made the robot travel back and forth between the same places, never going anywhere else. I never investigated why this error was happening but instead just kept restarting. Then I read the hint for this exercise and it confirmed that I was on the right track with my thinking but did not provide much anymore help. I did complete the exercise in my own way. I imagine that if I had investigated why I kept running into the same error then I would have completed the exercise earlier.

It is important to review the content that I have covered with The Nature of Code and Eloquent JavaScript. From this point on, I believe that for every chapter I complete in Eloquent JavaScript, I should review a chapter from the past. For The Nature of Code, I am blessed to have YouTube videos to accompany the material. I really have enjoyed watching the YouTube videos for The Nature of Code for Chapter 1 because of Shiffman's enthusiasm for the book's material. Also, fact that Shiffman is releasing new videos when I am working on completing the book is an another example of synchronicity. I am almost one fifth of the way through this challenge. I don't feel that I have accomplished much unfortunately.

### Day 16: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Read all of Chapter 7 of Eloquent JavaScript. Worked on my Ecosystem project from The Nature of Code.

**Thoughts:** Today was not a very productive day. After hanging out with my little brother last night, I was very lethargic during all of today. I was inspired that Shiffman liked another tweet of mine. I worked on my Ecoystem project for The Nature of Code. I practiced creating classes, one general Creature class and a class for different creature type. I used inheritance to share methods from the master Creature among all of the diffent creature types. I read through Chapter 7 of Eloquent JavaScript, which focused on a project instead of a concept. I learned a lot, specifically about building an automation, a little program that performs a task in a virtual world. Later today, I mistakenly opened up a pull request on the noc-examples-p5.js repository and I am annoyed because pull requests cannot be deleted from Github.

### Day 15: March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Chapter 1 of The Nature of Code. The content of this chapter and Chapter 6 of Eloquent JavaScript (object oriented programming, vectors, and encapsulation) are in harmony with each other.

**Thoughts:** I finally completed Chapter 1 of The Nature of Code. For Eloquent JavaScript, I have been completing a chapter day. For The Nature of Code, one chapter has taken me a whole week. However, I am not upset by my lack of progress because as I mentioned yesterday, the content of these latest chapters beautifully overlapped each other and when there is this sort of synchronicity, or "meaningful coincidences" show that I am on the right path. I am upset with myself because I did not commit any new code to Github today (actually writing this entry the day after). I almost had a full week where I made commits to Github every day.

### Day 14: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**:  Chapter 6 of Eloquent JavaScript and progresed a little more of Chapter 1 of The Nature of Code

**Thoughts:** Today the worlds of the two books I am reading, The Nature of Code and Eloquent JavaScript, have collided; both are discussing creating vectors, encapsulation, and creating classes. There is this strange feeling in me that I have written something similar in a previous attempt of this challenge. Today's entry is not very exciting and this is okay. I am finally starting to build a daily routine that includes coding. I am realizing that a lot of people have daily routines. I walk with my dog at the same time and pass by the same people. I feel like I have not had a daily routine; or if I did, it wasn't a healthy one, which ultimately lead me into chaos. Since starting this challenge, I have lost a little bit of weight and my chess scores have increased. Interestingly, the last time I committed to Github every day of the week was also the time when I had the highest chess scores for puzzles and blitz games than ever before.

### Day 13: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today is my two week mark (since I started my count at 0 like a programmer😎). I completed Chapter 5 of Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** This entry will be short. I completed another chapter today from Eloquent JavaScript today. I also was faced with the choice of whether or not to pay for Notion (the application I have been using to be taking notes for the book). I decided to not continue taking notes because I was just copying and pasting the material anyway. Why not just review the book, the source, when I need a refresher on the content? And as I mentioned yesterday, I should do this to keep the content fresh in my mind. These first five chapters have been easy for me, which proves I did gain some sort of knowledge over these past four, maybe five years, since I started the book. Wow, it has been four years since Hack Reactor, and look at me now. What have I really accomplished? Sometimes I really wish that I had just not went to Hack Reactor. It has cost me a lot of financial and emotional debt. Welp, I started this entry saying I would keep this short and here I am writing my head off. End it, Neil.

### Day 12: March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed Chapters 3 and 4 of Eloquent JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Once again, I am not satisfied with my progress. I desperately want to be finished with this book, Eloquent JavaScript. I wish to be able say that I finally have completed it! I'm looking at the Twitter statuses of others who are in the midst of this 100 Days of Code challenge and they are all working on actual projects and not trying to complete a book like me. "Neil, remember this is only the beginning of the challenge. There is plenty of time for work on other projects but Eloquent JavaScript has been on your reading list for years!" When I do complete this book, it will not be the end of this book. I know that I will need to review it often, making sure that the material has settled into my brain.

### Day 11: March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Chapter 2 , Program Structure, from the book Eloquent JavaScript (https://eloquentjavascript.net) by Marijn Haverbeke 

**Thoughts:** My work today feels like not much. In fact, I feel very anxious. I have gone through these same chapters (like 1 through 6) of the same book (Eloquent JavaScript) many times in the past _four_ years now, and each time, I have given up on completing the entire book for whatever reason. I have this guilty pain in me that I should already be done with the book. I completed a chapter with ease today but it is because I have gone through it many times before. I feel like I should have completed more than just one chapter today. But then, I breathe, and I remember that two weeks ago I completed no chapters at all. If I complete one chapter, or even just a part of one, I am still making some daily progress. I need to focus less on the finish line and just be sure that I am focusing on the now, completely understanding what material is currently in front of me.

### Day 10: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Turned my work from yesterday into a public Github pull request for the p5.js examples and exercises from the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code repository

**Thoughts:** I am ecstatic by the fact that Shiffman replied to my tweet and invited me to open up a pull request for the Nature of Code p5.js repository. I was debating with myself all yesterday wondering if I should keep contributing to a clone or a fork of The Nature of Code p5.js repository. I asked myself what is the point if Shiffman does not accept any pull requests? However, my fears have been swept away by this tweet from him. I now feel like I have a responsibility to contribute and also a sense of small purpose in this big great ocean that I am just a drop of.

Opening up a public Github pull request was a lot more challenging than I expected it to be. A couple of days ago, I opened up a pull request for some typos I found in the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code. Then I changed the name of the branch the pull request was attached to. Github made the renamed branch a new branch, so any additional changes I made in the renamed branch were not able to be added to the branch attached to the pull request. These are the learning pains I am experiencing with pull requests but it feels amazing to finally contribute to something, especially a repository that I love so dearly.

### Day 9: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Converted the exercises/examples that are in the original Processing (Java) repository but missing in the p5.js (JavaScript) repository for the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman and inserted them into my fork

**Thoughts:** Today's work, translating snippets of code from one language to another (Processing to p5.js) could be considered by some tedious, but for me, the result was worth the pain. I loved finally seeing my lines of code come to life in the form of small animations. A graph that visualizes noise distribution was one of the most simplest sketches I translated, but also is my favorite.

### Day 8: March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the examples and exercises of the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman. Also added the Chart component to the Bay Wheels Planner

**Thoughts:** Today I posted a video to my Twitter of a sketch I made for an exercise in the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code that brought color to the 3D Perlin Noise visualization. I also added some background music (After Hours by The Weekend). The combination of the visual and sound was amazing to me; a minature theactrical experience.

For the Bay Wheels Planner, I revised the logic for the elevation analysis and added the begginings of an elevation chart for each route. As it turns out, I did not perfectly understand the getElevations function from the Steepless application. As I worked on the Chart component, I realized the data the Chart component was receiving was not the same as what was needed to successfully function. Troubleshooting this was made difficult by the fact that the output of console.log(anObject) is misleading; The Chart component was behaving like it did not have any data but my console was showing that the data was there. I painfully learned that what is displayed in the console is not the state of the object when you console.log'd the object.

### Day 7: March 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: For Bay Wheels Planner, I implemented analysis of elevation changes between two stations. Also, improved user experience by removing Submit button and making the search for routes automatic. For Nature of Code, completed more Introduction exercises/examples

**Thoughts:** Every day, I get a little closer to having a most viable version of the Bay Wheels Planner. Today's milestone is obtaining all of the necessary data and properly analyzing it. Now, the next step is to display the data in an interactive visualization. It's funny how horrible I have been at estimating the completion of this project since I am months, maybe years, behind from when I originally guessed I might be done.

I used to have a Submit button in the Bay Wheels Planner that took up a whole row and also added an extra click for the user to move to the next step. I came to the conclusion that if the user has already selected origin and destination stations, then they should not have to click another time to submit. So, I removed the Submit button, but that required me to come with some logic for the automatic detection that both of the stations had been selected. The answer was within the ComomponentDidUpdate function.

In terms of the Nature of Code exercise and examples, I am not content with my recent contributions. Some of the alogorithms for the random walker, like Gaussian and a custom distribution, do not seem that unqiue from one another. I want to improve the way the movement of the random walker. I found a solution through one person's code that displayed lines between two vector points (start and end), instead of just making dots for each of the two vector points.

### Day 6: March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented a collection of calls to the Google Maps Elevation Service API for the available routes found between two Bay Wheels Bike stations with JavaScript Promises

**Thoughts:**
To be honest, this is not the first time that I have attempted to create a Bay Wheels Planner application through using the old Steepless code. However, in my previous versions, I did not care how I obtained the elevation data of the available routes between two stations. 

I needed to reteach myself JavaScript promises, and to do so, I used my two best current resources, Treehouse and the book Eloqent JavaScript. I appreciate Treehouse for providing amazing video tutorials and Eloquent JavaScript for describing the material in writing. My last shoutout would be to the Mozilla Documentation, however, I do not like straight documentation because it is hard for me to learn about concepts without any context/story.

### Day 5: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a paint splatter simulation that uses a normal distribution of random numbers to generate the dots positions and colors.

**Thoughts:** I was very tempted to copy the answers for the exercises for the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code from another person's Github repository. I am copying the exercise answers from Shiffman's repository. Well, only sort of since I am converting them from Processing into p5.js. 

I particularly love an exercise from the Introduction chapter of The Nature of Code that demonstrates how a normal distribution can be affected by a change in the standard deviation. I feel like I better understand what the world is trying to accomplish by quarantining due to the COVID-19 virus. We want to accomplish flattening the bell curve. If there is not such a spike in virus cases, then we do not overwhelm our current health care system.

### Day 4: March 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I found the official YouTube learning playlist for the Nature of Code. I supplemented my reading of the Introduction chapter with watching the videos and worked through the exercises.

**Thoughts:** I skipped a day of this challenge because I drank too much alcohol, my 'ol nemesis in life, on the night of March 14, 2020. Instead of enjoying the small but continuous daily gains of learning, which benefit the overall plan of my professional development, I chose to instead joy the short-term pleasing but long-term destructive effects of ethanol. I need to stop escaping my currently mediocre life through it.

When I found that Daniel Shiffman is this year working to revamp the YouTube content for the Nature of Code, I found it to be a sign that I am working through the content at the perfect time. It's awesome that he has not let the Nature of Code to become something stale; Instead he continually works to improve it. Translating his exercises from Processing to p5 is 'easy' but also is helpful to helping me to understand the p5.js library more and more.

### Day 3: March 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the implementation of the Google Maps JavaScript API for the Bay Wheels Planner and the Introduction chapter of Nature of Code

**Thoughts:**
Getting the directions from the Google Maps JavaScript API was easy but the elevations part was difficult because it required making an Google Maps API call, analyzing and transforming the results, then making another Google Maps API call. I am in the middle of retaking the Asynchronous Programming with JavaScript course from Treehouse because of my rusty familiarity of the different methods.

I completed reading through the Introduction of Daniel Shiffman's, The Nature of Code, and I learned about the different ways to implement randomness. I do not feel I thoroughly understand the material because I was not able to complete the exercises in the Introduction chapter. Today I made goals for the different things I want to accomplish during this challenge. Even if I only complete some of the tasks on my goal list I will be happy since many of these things have been on my To-Do list for two or more years.

### Day 2: March 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying the code of Steepless and also started reading the Nature of Code

**Thoughts:**
Today I deleted the code from my Bay Wheels Planner application just thrown in from the Steepless project without any understanding to what it did. Let's be real, the Steepless application is already better in a lot of ways (timing of release, the larger scope of audience, etc.), but my purpose for making Bay Wheels Planner is to use it as a project to learn from and honestly enjoy. The official Bay Wheels app does not have such a feature yet, or really any planning feature, so I am happy to learn and make something useful (even if only for myself).

Reading Daniel Shiffman's 'The Nature of Code' is always something I have wanted to do and it will be done by the end of this challenge. Sure the technology is nothing that will get me a job (p5.js is not a very desired technology skill), but as my Tweet said for today, 'Nice thing bout havin a cool job (and not job searchin) is that I can work on the stuff I love ❤️ without worry if I'm 'doing the right thing.'

### Day 1: March 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Continued studying the code of Steepless

**Thoughts:**
When I have a very a little amount of lines of code to commit to Github, I feel that I am unproductive. However, contrary to my belief, a deeper understanding of the code I am trying to implement is what will make my application great. The way I approach art and coding is similar; I start each project with no plan and usually, they turn out fine. However, with code, I know it will help me to understand each part of a project integrates with another. Otherwise, it will get messy. Also, I won't be able to talk to anyone about it.

### Day 0: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Life project, studied the code of Steepless

**Thoughts:**
Today I restart this challenge. I do not want to count how many times I have restarted. I looked up Lim Chee Aun, the creator of Steepless, the application that I am using parts of it's code for my Bay Wheels Planner application. Lim Chee Aun was featured on Hacker News for his Life application (https://github.com/cheeaun/life). Today I made a fork of his Life project to help map out my own life.
