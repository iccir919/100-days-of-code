# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: Februrary 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Added content and better HTML structure to my Responisve Web Design Projects

**Thoughts:** I am going back-to-the-basics by going through the [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) course from Mozilla. I have already completed the [HTML Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-basics-2) course from Treehouse but there are still some gaps in my HTML knowledge.

In addition to completing my Bay Wheels Planner and the Bay Wheels Data Analysis projects, my reach goal for this 100 Days of Code challenge is to complete the following sections from the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum (after two years of attempts):
- Responsive Web Design Projects
- JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structure Projects
- Front End Libraries Projects
- Data Visualization Projects
- APIs and Microservices Projects

### Day 3: Februrary 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Rewrote the code for the Marker components in the Bay Area Planner and added more tests to the Pomodoro Clock

**Thoughts:** How to get over the feeling of not doing enough? I have this problem, especially since it has been two **years** since I completed the [Hack Reactor](https://www.hackreactor.com/) bootcamp, which was very expensive and did not change my career as advertised on their website. Yet, after reviewing my portfolio today, the code I have displayed is not very complex or impressive.

To make up for lost time, I am trying harder than ever to make my current and future projects extraordinary. It would be amazing, yet unrealistic based off my history, to keep up this momentum for fifty, even twenty days. Since I graduated Hack Reactor, I kept telling myself that I need to learn how to write tests; now, I am finally writing them!

### Day 2: Februrary 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the article Main Concepts from React docs, worked on adding tests to Pomodoro Clock project, and rendered markers on the map for Bay Wheels Planner

**Thoughts:**
Finished reading the [Main Concepts of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) article I wrote about yesterday and it is an excellent reference. It really hammers on the fundamentals of React. For Bay Wheels Planner, I am I was able to get all of the e-bikes or station locations for the Bay Wheels system to render on my map.

Today I did something I have never done before, I wrote a test; well, converted it from freeCodeCamp to my project using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/). But hey, whether my creation or not, I am proud of it. My hope is that I write my tests accurate enough to where I can just run the freeCodeCamp tests once I am complete and they will ALL pass on the first try.

### Day 1: February 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Restarting mapping tool to find flattest routes and avoid the hilliest routes for the [Bay Wheels](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) bike share system.

**Thoughts:**
I am excited to restart this challenge. It has been 10 months since I last attempted it. **I will not fail this time.** Bay Wheels Planner, my newest application, will be made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a declarative and component-based JavaScript library. 

Since it has been a while (and the API has maybe changed since I last worked with React), I have completed the first half of article about the [Main Concepts of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html). I am taking notes from the tutorial (more like copy and pasting key parts of the tutorial) in a neat application called Notion, like an online journal
