# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarting mapping tool to find flattest routes and avoid the hilliest routes.

**Thoughts:**
I am excited to restart this challenge. It has been 10 months since I last attempted it. **I will not fail this time.** This application will be made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a declarative and component-based JavaScript library. Since it has been a while (and the API has maybe changed since I last worked with React), I have completed both tutorials offered on the offical website.
