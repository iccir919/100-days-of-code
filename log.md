# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added map.gl to the Ford GoBike Dashboard (removing Google Maps) and started work on another question from Cracking the Coding Interview

**Thoughts:** 
I restarted another project from the past, my answers from the questions in the book Cracking the Coding Interview. It hurts me a little to bit know how long this book has been sitting on my desk and how many interviews it could have saved me. The key will be me finishing it this time!

I replaced Google Maps from my Ford GoBike project with map.gl with the hopes of adding deck.gl soon. I want my map visualization to be even more beautiful than the first version with me and p5.js. There was some difficulty making the map responsive but I found help within the Vis Academy. Then, since I couldn't find the answer within the [issue on Github](https://github.com/uber/react-map-gl/issues/135), I posted a link to the tutorial. This is the first time that I have responded to an issue on Github!

### Day 0: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Ford GoBike Dashboard, and the App Script project for the University of Haifa

**Thoughts:** 
This past week has been one of the worst for me in terms of coding. Despite having time to code, for some reason I did not do it. I am committing today to coding for at least one hour a day on a project. It is not good for me to code a lot during one day of the week and then completely remove myself from code from all the others. 

For my Ford GoBike Dashboard project, I wanted to use one of the latest data visualiation libraries, [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis), but ultimately I decide to continue using Chartist and hopefully, in the future, I will switch over.

I restarted the Vis Academy today. I started it in January and never got around to finishing it. Actually, currently it is impossible to finish because part of the course is obsolete because of the newer version of the library.
