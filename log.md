# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: Februrary 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed 

**Thoughts:**
Finished reading the React article I wrote about yesterday and it is an excellent reference. It really hammers on the fundamentals of React. For Bay Wheels Planner, I am I was able to get all of the e-bikes or station locations for the Bay Wheels system to render on my map.

Today I did something I have never done before, I wrote a test; well, converted it from freeCodeCamp to my project using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/). But hey, whether my creation or not, I am proud of it. My hope is that I write my tests accurate enough to where I can just run the freeCodeCamp tests once I am complete and they will ALL pass on the first try.

### Day 1: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarting mapping tool to find flattest routes and avoid the hilliest routes for the [Bay Wheels](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) bike share system.

**Thoughts:**
I am excited to restart this challenge. It has been 10 months since I last attempted it. **I will not fail this time.** Bay Wheels Planner, my newest application, will be made with [React](https://reactjs.org/), a declarative and component-based JavaScript library. 

Since it has been a while (and the API has maybe changed since I last worked with React), I have completed the first half of article about the Main Concepts of React (see link below). I am taking notes from the tutorial (more like copy and pasting key parts of the tutorial) in a neat application called Notion, like an online journal
