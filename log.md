# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarted blog, restarted Ford GoBike dashboard

**Thoughts:** Sometimes when I restart I feel like I am moving backwards, but today, I feel like I am moving forward. My last Ford GoBike Dashboard was made with Bootstrap. Now, this version will have React too.

I have to restart my blog because there is a node version error that I do not have the time to look into and fix. I figure a fresh start is probably the best way for this situation. Looking forward to some great accomplishments in the future!
